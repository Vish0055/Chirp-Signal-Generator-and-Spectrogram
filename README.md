# Chirp-Signal-Generator-and-Spectrogram
This repository contains code to generate four types of chirp signals:

-Logarithmic chirp
-Hyperbolic chirp
-Linear chirp
-Artificial chirp (cosine with non-linear frequency modulation)
It also includes functionality to create spectrograms of these signals for analysis purposes.

# Requirements
Python 3.x
Required libraries: NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy, librosa
